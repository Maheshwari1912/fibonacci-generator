**Introduction to Fibonacci Generator in Verilog**

The Fibonacci sequence is a well-known mathematical series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. 

It is commonly used in various applications such as cryptography, pseudo-random number generation, and digital signal processing.

In hardware design, implementing a Fibonacci Generator using Verilog allows us to efficiently compute and store Fibonacci numbers in a sequential manner. This can be achieved using registers, adders, and control logic to iteratively or recursively generate the sequence.

**Objective**

The goal of this project is to design a Fibonacci Number Generator using Verilog HDL that:

Computes Fibonacci numbers sequentially.

Uses sequential logic with registers to store and update values.

Can be implemented on an FPGA or simulated in a testbench.

Supports parameterization for different Fibonacci sequence lengths.

This implementation can be useful in hardware accelerators, randomized testing, and DSP applications.
